/**
 * How React.lazy Works
 * âœ… What it does:
 *    React.lazy() lets you dynamically import components.
 *    It works with <Suspense> to show a fallback UI during loading.
 * 
 * â›” Drawbacks in SSR:
 * Runs only in the browser (client-side):
 *  React.lazy() defers loading the component until runtime in the browser.
 *  On the server, it has no way to wait for or preload the component.
 *  That means the server canâ€™t render it ahead of time â†’ blank/empty content.
 * Fails silently in SSR:
 *  ReactDOMServer.renderToString() canâ€™t handle React.lazy() out of the box.
 *  Youâ€™ll either get an empty div or a crash with no helpful output.
 * 
 * âœ… Experiment: Try React.lazy in your current SSR app
 * If you wrap your lazy component inside <Suspense> and try to render it on the server, you'll likely see:
 *    Empty content
 *    Or an error like: Error: A component suspended while rendering, but no fallback UI was specified.
 * 
 * React.lazy()
 * You will likely see:
 *  ðŸ”´ A blank screen or
 *  ðŸ”´ Console error:
 *      Error: A component suspended while rendering, but no fallback UI was specified.
 * Even though you provided a fallback in <Suspense>, it only works in the browser.
 * 
 * React.lazy uses Suspense, and Reactâ€™s server-side renderer (renderToString) doesn't support Suspense for data or lazy-loaded components
